# Memento v0.0, a notepad for webOS

## Goals

This is an attempt to build a better notepad for my Palm Pre, with a companion
PHP app in the "cloud" with which to sync and edit notes on the desktop.

It's also an attempt at building an app with code quality and tests suitable
for eventual write-up as a tutorial.

## Installation

Have fun!  Details will eventually emerge.

## License

Still thinking about this.  

I've got a notion it would be nice to sell the app for a couple of bucks once
it's production quality, while still keeping it open source.  If you go through
the trouble to install the SDK, grab the source, and install it - kudos to you,
and please send patches.  If you just want a notepad app, spend a couple of
bucks and save yourself some time.

But, I'm not there yet.
